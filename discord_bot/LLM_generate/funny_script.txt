[Narrator] Welcome to today's EigenFunnest Moments! In a Discord server where math meets madness and teeth are on the menu, things get weird. Fasten your seatbelts and prepare to chew on some of the most delightfully bonkers messages of the day. Let's dive in! Number five. 
[a_licee] eigenvectors are yummy! 
[Narrator] Because nothing says “deep into linear algebra” like treating them like snacks. Who knew eigenvalues had a snack-size cousin? Number four. 
[lineee.xt] do i have complex teeth??? 
[Narrator] A real question in a world where chewing on imaginary numbers is totally normal. Next stop: orthodontic nightmares and math puns. Number three. 
[reee.na] I was chewing Lynn's teeth and I can confirm they are indeed complex 
[Narrator] Because why not turn casual tooth-chewing into a lesson in imaginary parts? Who needs dentists when you’ve got eigenfriends? Number two. 
[reee.na] How are comedians funny on demand?
[a_licee] they get paid for it 
[Narrator] A chillingly realistic look at the comedy industry, delivered by a group of teens who think eigenvectors can be real. Number one. 
[richa._1] Eat your broccoli 
[Narrator] The random broccoli punchline dropped into a math-fueled chaos storm like it was the logical next step. Which, honestly, it kind of was. 
[Narrator] And there you have it—five messages that prove this Discord server is one part calculus, one part chaos, and two parts chewing on things they probably shouldn’t. Stay complex, stay crunchy, and for the love of eigenvalues, maybe brush your teeth.
