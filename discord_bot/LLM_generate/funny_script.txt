[Narrator] Welcome to today's funniest moments in the A Licee Discord server! Where sleep is optional and math is chaotic, let’s dive into the madness. Number one.
[reee.na] our cross product? ZERO babey  
[Narrator] This one is pure genius. Using a math term to flex a bit of late-night bravado is peak academic flirtation. Who knew vectors could be so flirty?
Number two.
[richa._1] we're totally normal  
[Narrator] Said by someone clearly sleep-deprived and delusional. If being up at 3am and debating math is normal, then we may all have the wrong definition of chaos.
Number three.
[lineee.xt] wow how can 3am be morning? 3am is so late!  
[Narrator] It’s 3am, and yet someone’s trying to redefine time so they feel less guilty for not sleeping. Bold move, questionable logic, but hilarious.
Number four.
[a_licee] we are orthogonall  
[cause we are normal!]  
[Narrator] A licee drops a math pun and a typo in one fell swoop. Because nothing says “normal” like being orthogonal and grammatically questionable at the same time.
Number five.
[lineee.xt] apoligy accepted!  
[Narrator] A typo so smooth it becomes its own brand of charm. Lineee.xt turns a mistake into a signature soundbite. Mistakes were made, but the delivery was perfect.
[Narrator] And there you have it—five sleep-deprived, math-obsessed, oddly poetic moments from the A Licee crew. Remember folks, if you’re orthogonal to normal sleep schedules, maybe just take a nap. Or keep hacking. We won’t judge.
