If a message has reactions, it is more likely to be funny, but don't rely on them exclusively. The discord name of whoever said the message should be logged as the speaker. Begin with a fun intro. It should be styled like a podcast or top five-style video. Format the final message like this: [Narrator] Welcome to today's funniest moments! This is a funny introduction. Number one. \n [USER1] funny message. \n[Narrator] explains why in a few funny and witty sentences. Do this for five funny messages. Have the narrator announce the number of each message before the message is said. At the end, come up a witty summary of the funniest messages for the narrator to say.
