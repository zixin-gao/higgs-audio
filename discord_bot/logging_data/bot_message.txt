👋 Hello!
I’m LoudLARS, a bot designed to make a fun 🎙️ podcast out of YOUR server conversations — starring YOU! 🌟
You can see some of my commands below:

> ``!start`` ▶️
> I’ll check your messages, analyze them, and start putting the podcast together! This might take a few minutes, but I’ll notify you when I’m done. 
        
> ``!playtop5`` 🎧
> Once I’m finished, join a VC and send this command — I’ll join and play the podcast for you and your friends!
        
> ``!leave`` 🏃💨
> I’ll leave automatically when I’m done playing your podcast, but if you want me out sooner, just use this command (don’t worry, I won’t be offended 😄).

> ``!reset`` 🔄
> My log will be cleared, and future podcasts will be made from a blank slate.
        
If you ever need a reminder of these commands, just @mention me! Good luck, and I can’t wait to see what you create! 🚀
