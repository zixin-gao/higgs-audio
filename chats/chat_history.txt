[Narrator] Welcome to today’s *Top Five Discord Meltdowns*! Buckle up, because this group chat is either a support group for sentient dogs or just really into the word “goodbye.” Let’s dive into the chaos!

Number five.
[lineee.xt] "i swear discord is haunted!! my mic unmutes itself"
[Narrator] Because nothing says “I’m emotionally ready for relationships” like blaming the supernatural for your audio issues.

Number four.
[richa._1] "6:30 is the funniest time on the clock, hands down"
[Narrator] It’s not a time—it’s a vibe. 6:30 is the awkward cousin of 6:00 and 7:00. Also, “hands down” while referencing the hands of the clock? That’s one of those deep truths we all agree on.

Number three.
[richa._1] "i’m hungry! hi hungry!"
[Narrator] This is philosophical. This is poetic. This is also very likely how a toaster would greet another toaster in a sci-fi movie.

Number two.
[linee.xt] "i'm pushing to github!"
[richa._1] "Try to pull"
[Narrator] Cue the dramatic music. This is the moment reee.na became a legend among their peers. Not because they were funny, but because they were *technically* funny and got triple hearted.

Number one.
[reee.na] "you were bigger than the whole sky"
[Narrator] Is this a breakup poem? A haiku about a balloon? Or just reee.na trying to sound like a sad anime character? We may never know. But it’s beautiful, it’s cryptic, and it’s number one.

[Narrator] And that’s a wrap on today’s top five. One part existential crisis, two parts dog impressions, and three parts “why are you typing goodbye 10 times?” Stay weird, stay woofy, and remember: 6:30 is always the vibe.
